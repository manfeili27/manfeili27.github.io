## [Are Millennials Spoiled Kids? Age and Generation Effects on Luxury Expenditure](download/jmp_manfei_li.pdf 'jmp_manfei_li.pdf')

*Most Inspirational Conference Paper Award, European Academy of Management (EURAM) 2021 Conference, June 2021*

Millenials have attracted attention in marketing research because they spend a higher share of their expenses on luxury goods than any preceding generation. It remains unclear, however, to which extent this is explained by their young age. In this paper I study the influence of age and generation effects on luxury expenditure. Using panel data on consumption behavior from the US, I separately identify age and generation effects on luxury expenditure using a variety of different approaches. First, I estimate panel regression models including a full set of age and generation dummies plus a long list of other demographic characteristics. Next, I leverage tools from supervised machine learning, which allow for flexibly non-linear and interactive relationships between the variables. All approaches consistently show that, conditional on age and other demographics, Millenials spend less on luxury goods than the preceding generations, both in absolute terms and as a share of total expenditure. The high luxury expenditure share of Millenials observed in the cross section can be fully attributed to their young age. These results challenge the conventional view of Millenials as a spoiled generation indulging in luxury.
