## [Are Millennials Spoiled Kids? Age and Generation Effects on Luxury Expenditure](download/jmp_manfei_li.pdf 'jmp_manfei_li.pdf') `#009440`
Considered as a protected and indulged generation, Millennials attract attentions in luxury market for their seemingly extraordinary spending power. But since they are also biologically younger, it remains unclear whether they would still behave differently conditional on age. Using data from the Consumer Expenditure survey (CE) of the U.S., I firstly classify individual expenditure categories into luxury and necessity based on estimated total expenditure elasticity. After descriptively presenting overall luxury expenditure patterns over life cycle and across time, I decompose age and generation effects on luxury expenditure according to a textbook regression identification. I find all generations follow a trend of decreasing luxury expenditure over life cycle, while earlier born generations tend to buy more at any given age. The results are consistent even in a flexibly nonlinear and interactive machine learning setting, i.e., neural network. The findings in this paper attribute the stereotype of Millennials to the effect of their young age which counteracts the opposite generation effect, and challenges the conventional image of Millennials by relabeling them as actually abstinent from luxury.
