I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU Munich).

My research interests are consumer preferences and demographic trends.

I will be on the job market in 2021/22. Here you can see my [CV](download/cv_manfei_li.pdf 'cv_manfei_li.pdf') and my [job market paper](download/jmp_manfei_li.pdf 'jmp_manfei_li.pdf').
